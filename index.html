    <!-- Introduction to Lentil Soup -->
    <section id="intro">
      <p>This creamy vegan lentil soup is my favorite to enjoy at Turkish restaurants. It is loaded with vegetables and so flavorful from all the spices and dried mint. It is delicious served with some crusty bread and a squeeze of lemon juice.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Mercimek Çorbası is a very popular soup in Turkish cuisine. This lentil soup has been a staple in Turkey for centuries. Lentils are incredibly popular throughout the entire Mediterranean. There are so many different types. The red lentils are what is used in this dish. They come red/orange in color and turn yellow once cooked. They can be found at almost all grocery stores.</p>
